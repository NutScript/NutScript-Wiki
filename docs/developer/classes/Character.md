Base character class.
 A character is a unique entity tied to a player client. Each client can have multiple characters.
The character stores information that is relevant to the gameplay, but not specific to the player themselves, for instance: their model, name, description, inventory, etc.

All characters that a player owns are loaded into server memory upon the client connecting.
