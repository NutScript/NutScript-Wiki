Base class for players.

The client, aka the [Player](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player), represents the base entity controlled by the physical player.
A client can have more than one character attached, but a character can have no more and no less than 1 client attached.

Functions and meta-methods defined in Gmod outside of NutScript typically target the client.
