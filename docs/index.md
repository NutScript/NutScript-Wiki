NutScript is a free roleplay framework created by Chessnut and Black Tea for use in the game Garry's Mod. Prior to NutScript's creation, Clockwork and OpenAura were the two main roleplaying frameworks. Since it's release, Nutscript has been gaining popularity due to it's DRM-free schema creation, and open source code. Nutscript 1.2 is a complete re-write of the framework. We recommend only using 1.2 branch located here: <https://github.com/NutScript/NutScript>{:target="_blank"}.
